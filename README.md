# Centipede remake for Bini Bambini

Original game:  
Centipede (1980) arcade video game. 

Description:
The player's machine gun is represented by a small object at the bottom of the screen. The player moves the gun around the bottom area of the screen with arrows (or other keys) and  shoots  at  a  centipede  advancing  from  the top of the screen down through a field of mushrooms.  Shooting  any  section  of  the  centipede  creates  a  mushroom  and  makes centipede shorter; If the head is shot, the section behind it becomes the next head. 
The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. When it hits a mushroom or the edge of the screen, it drops one level and switches direction. The player can  destroy  mushrooms  by  shooting  them,  but  each  takes  several  shots  to  destroy. Mushrooms can be placed randomly or statically. If the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, game over. When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, level is completed.
Shooting  one  of  the  middle  segments  splits  the  centipede  into  two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with the first section of the rear piece becoming a new head.
If  the  centipede  reaches  the bottom of the screen, player loses one life. When all lives is gone game over.
Endless mode.
